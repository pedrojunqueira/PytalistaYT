-   How to set up and run
-   Demostrate the basics of pandas and how to get started


## Why use the VS code extension

- get access to all VS code shorcuts 
- use in dark mode
- Can attach Notebook kernel to a virtual environment
- Does not require to run a server

## other Alternative

- Use Google Colab (Free)
- Use other alternatives like Azure Notebooks (Machine Learning Studio)
- Run your own Jupyter notebook server locally

1. Datamodel
    * Series
    * DataFrame
2. Import Data
    * csv
    * sql
3. DataFrame methods and atributes
